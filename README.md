# Express + TypeScript API Starter

A robust and scalable starter template for building Node.js APIs with **Express** and **TypeScript**. This setup supports both TypeScript and JavaScript files, enabling rapid development and easy deployment to platforms like **Vercel**, **AWS Lambda**, **Render**, or any Node.js hosting service.

## Features

-   🛠️ **TypeScript and JavaScript Support**: Mix `.ts` and `.js` files seamlessly in your codebase.
-   🔥 **Hot Reloading**: Powered by `ts-node-dev` for fast iteration during development, with live reloading for both `.ts` and `.js` files.
-   🚀 **Optimized for Deployment**: Easily deploy to Vercel, AWS Lambda, Render, or other platforms with minimal configuration.
-   📂 **Clean File Structure**: Organized `src` directory with routes, middlewares, and more for easy scalability.
-   🏗️ **TypeScript Configuration**: Pre-configured `tsconfig.json` for strict type-checking and fast builds.
-   💡 **Express Integration**: Quickly create RESTful APIs with Express.

## Getting Started
